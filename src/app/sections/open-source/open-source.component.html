                As a fan of all things Open Source, I not only love discovering new libraries, packages and frameworks but, in my small way, when I have time, I try to create something that the whole developer community can use.

                All my projects are obviously open source and freely usable. The projects are mainly located in two different places: my github profile, and on QuokkaDev's GitHub profile.

                On my personal profile you can find the sources of this site, a couple of PWAs (progressive web apps) and some example solutions that I used when I taught courses with clients or in some high school classes.

                QuokkaDev is an organization that I created on GitHub mainly to understand how these objects work and on which I then versioned all my most "important" open projects. Most projects on QuokkaDev have continuous integration pipelines which then generate reports. QuokkaDev's projects are also the best documented ones (not all ðŸ˜€).
