                As a fan of all things Open Source, I not only love discovering new libraries, packages and frameworks but, in my small way, when I have time, I try to create something that the whole developer community can use.

                QuokkaDev is an organization that I created on GitHub mainly to understand how these objects work and on which I then versioned all my most "important" open projects. Most projects on QuokkaDev have continuous integration pipelines which then generate reports. QuokkaDev's projects are also the best documented ones (not all ðŸ˜€).

                quokka-time-tracker is a progressive web app built in Angular that allows you to keep track of the activities performed during the day.
                Just enter the description of the activity and press the start button to start the timer and when the activity
                is finished it stops; you can restart the same activity multiple times and multiple intervals will be tracked.
                At any time you can access a report with all the recorded activities, grouped by day, with the total time spent on each activity.
                I made this app to remind me exactly how much time I spend each day on each client's activities.

                quokkadev-middleware-correlation is a NuGet package for handling a unique correlation id in HTTP calls.
                It allows to recognize the correlation id provided by the caller through a configurable header or to configure a new one if it is not present.
                Among the various features there is the possibility of automatically forwarding the correlation ID
                in calls to other services via HttpClient and the possibility of automatically enriching the log context with the correlation ID.
                The package is especially useful in projects that will be deployed in a microservices infrastructure.

                quokkadev-saas is a set of NuGet packages that should help in the development of cloud applications

                an be used by different customers.
                The packages are born from the experience gained on a project where I faced this type of problem
                and include various features including: recognition of the tenant being accessed, data segregation by tenant,
                the ability to manage different application configurations for each tenant and differentiated authentication.
                The projects are still in an embryonic state and need some work, especially in terms of documentation,
                but they are still a good basis from which to start if you have to deal with these issues.
